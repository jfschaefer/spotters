# Collection of Spotters

A collection of spotters.
This is not part of SpotterBase to
1. avoid ending lots of task-specific code to SpotterBase,
2. avoid unnecessary dependencies of SpotterBase,
3. allow for different licenses than SpotterBase.

Furthermore, the spotters tend to have a much lower code quality.

## Licenses

Individual spotters may have different licenses.
If a spotter does not have a license or you need a different one, please reach out/make an issue.
